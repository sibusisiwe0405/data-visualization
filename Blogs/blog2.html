                What is User Interface and User Experience? UI and UX design are the process in which a design makes a product but in this case a website which is user friendly and how the user feels when making use of the product. Every designer wants the user to have an enjoyable experience with their product and therefore they need good UI to execute this. For the course of this semester I will be building a website that reflects a dataset of my choosing using an API. 
                In this blog I will be critically reflecting on my UI and UX for my website by speaking on what I have learnt, still to implement and relate it to theory learnt from lectures. A good User Interface is very important for a good User Experience therefore as a designer I want to a smooth and enjoyable experience as possible (UXPin, 2022). 
                What I currently have right now is not the final product and there may be some changes such as how I would like to place my navigation bar and how I would want to position my content.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wireframes that I have currently are of what I would like my landing page to look like and what I have now as the prototype. As a user of other websites, I notice that I enjoy websites that are simple and straight forward to use and that is what I am aiming for. 
                I want to make life easy for the user. My audience for this website would be young people, who are into new trends and pop culture and minimalistic aesthetics are the in things these days which is why I am creating a minimal and simplistic interface that they can interact with and appeal to.
                 I want them to have a calm and easy experience by not having anything that would confuse them and not have to toggle around with actions to move onto the next page. My clickable links are clear and are highlighted when a user hovers over them giving clear indications that they can be touched. The navigation bar for the meantime while I figure out a fun and cool way to create it, is at the top of the page with clearly labelled tabs with the footer at the bottom of the page.
                  The reason I want to create a different looking nav bar is because I want my website to have a modern feel to it however I risk confusing my audience as I would be changing something they are already familiar with.

                With the goal of creating accessibility, I want to have my home webpage long where the user is able to scroll to get to the other tabs. They would not have to go to the navigation bar to click on the tabs, however I still not need to actively think this through and see how it would work because this is still a work in progress and some of the code I have tried hasnâ€™t been successful, and the final product will be better than what I have now. 
                I want my color palate to create accessibility for people with disabilities such as colour-blindness. The color combination is bright and vibrant which adds a popping visual because half the website will have writing on it which is already boring, so I want to add more appealing visuals to make up for this. Young people as we know do not really want to read pages and pages of text, though it may be informative it has to also appeal to the eye therefore I have added images in-between blogs.
                 Ideally, I would like to add more visuals that users can interact with as they navigate the website. The data visualization graphs and charts will also add to the visual side of things therefore I want them to look interesting to engage with and try balance out the loads of text from blogs with visuals. I am aiming to have a consistent structure for my site because consistent is predictable and something that is predictable is easy to understand (UXPin, 2022). Things such as background color, text fonts for headings and normal text will be the same on every page and the use of grids helps with creating visual order. 
                 In the blog post section I have added next and previous buttons so that I have clear next steps which give a clear indication of what the user can do next. 
                Some of the blogs will be long so I will also have a back to  the top button so the user can move onto the next page.

                In conclusion my website has a long way to go with some possible changes that I would like to implement. I have not spoken much on font and color scheme because these are things I will be changing for the next prototype as I have considered things like accessibility for the visually impaired so I will have a different color scheme. 
                In this critical reflection I have looked at my website and some of the basic UI design principles and connected them to what I have done. It is also important to note that as a designer you can never appeal or satisfy every user so therefore as long as the basic principles are applied you may come close to it (UXPin, 2022).
                 This is also due to the fact that UX is unique and different to people with combinations of a number of elements such as the product and the users internal emotional state (Tractinsky, 2006).
