            <p>
                For the course of this semester I will be building a website that reflects a dataset of my choosing using an API. At this stage I do not have a clear picture which topic I would like to work on which has affected me choosing a style format I want for the website. 
                What I currently have right now is not the final product and there may be some changes such as how I would like to place my navigation bar and how I would want to position my content.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wireframes that I have currently are of what I would like my landing page to look like and what I have now as the prototype. As a user of other websites, I notice that I enjoy websites that are simple and straight forward to use and that is what I am aiming for. 
                My audience for this website would be young people, who are into new trends and pop culture and minimalistic aesthetics are the in things these days which is why I am creating a minimal and simplistic interface that they can interact with and appeal to. I want them to have a calm and easy experience and not have to toggle around with actions to move onto the next page. 
                My clickable links are clear and are highlighted when a user hovers over them giving clear indications that they can be touched. The navigation bar for the meantime while I figure out a fun and cool way to create it, is at the top of the page with clearly labelled tabs with the footer and the bottom of the page.

                With the goal of creating accessibility, I want to have my home webpage long where the user is able to scroll to get to the other tabs. They would not have to go to the navigation bar to click on the tabs, however I still not need to actively think this through and see how it would work because this is still the first prototype, and the final product will be better than what I have now.
                 My color palate is minimal browns and I think I might change this or add just one bright color to add a popping visual because half the website will have writing on it which is already boring, so I want to add more appealing visuals to make up for this. Young people as we know do not really want to read pages and pages of text, though it may be informative it has to also appeal to the eye therefore I have added images in-between blogs. 
                 Ideally, I would like to add more visuals that users can interact with as they navigate the website. 
                The data visualization graphs and charts will also add to the visual side of things therefore I want them to look interesting to engage with and try balance out the loads of text from blogs with visuals.

                In conclusion my website has a long way to go with some possible changes that I would like to implement. I have not spoken much on font and color scheme because these are things I will be changing for the next prototype I will be submitting.
