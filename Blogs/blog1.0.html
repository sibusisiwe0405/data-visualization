            <p>The use of data visualization has been useful dating back in history for recording historical events and for investigation purposes. 
                It has also played a part in many human discoveries and inventions (Li, 2020). Data visualization plays a big part in research and with the advancements that have come with software development is it even easier to represent data in ways that many people can use and understand.
                 In this refection piece I will be looking and what data visualization is, what data and information are and how they can be visually represented and the different kinds of visualization, i.e. visual and scientific representation. </p>
                 
                 <p>
                    A number of advantages of traditional data visualization have been identified such as its ability to represent data immediately, identifying patterns for providing new insights, it can be useful for product quality control and identifying problems, and lastly help with the understanding of big and small data (Li, 2020). 
                    Data visualization makes use of images of graphs and charts to represent data and help in making decisions. I think this invention of data visualization was a great idea due to many reasons, one being not everyone is mathematically or scientifically inclined therefore if they were to look at raw data or a whole lot of information they would not quite understand what is going on and would need someone to explain to them.
                     This way of representing data allows people to make informed decisions without having to have someone else explain to you what is what and this is speaks to either research purposes or financial investments and many other things that data is used for.
                      Like any other concept data visualization has a number of meanings that people have coined over the years however I will be speaking of the one I find gives a better understanding, which is ‘ the use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representations of data to amplify cognition’ (Li, 2020), or  Kirks definition ‘the representation and presentation of data that exploits our visual perception abilities in order to amplify cognition’ (Li, 2020). 
                    In knowing and understanding this term of concept it is also important to know the differences between data and information.

                    Within the concept of visualization the terms data and information are often used in an interrelated context, as visualization is about the presentation of data and information. 
                    There are many different definition for data and information in the various fields of study and their uses are often conflicting (Chen, 2008). Data is said to be symbols and models that represent real entities and information is data that has been processed to something understandable which is able to answer questions. 
                    I like to think of it as data being the small particles collected from various places that is then brought together to formulate coherent statements or rather information for people to understand and get answers to they questions they might have.
                     Data itself has no meaning until it has been taken and processed into information.

                    I will now be discussing the four main traditional data visualizations that can be used for different purposes and in different fields of research. The first one I will look at are Trees which are one of the earliest form of data visualization. 
                    Trees in a general sense start from the root up to the top of the leaves and this is a good structure to represent a hierarchy i.e. an organisational structure for a company could have been represented in a tree-map. The second visualization that dates back in history is maps. 
                    They are a graphical illustration of relationships between elements of space and a 2D representation of the surface of the world (Li, 2020). Maps are still used till today for geographical purposes though they have been computerized and we see less of the paper ones. There are four different kinds of maps; political maps for territory markings, physical maps for features of geography, topographic maps that are for elevation with contour lines and lastly geologic maps that represent geological features (Li, 2020). 
                    The advancement of technology has also come with various ways maps can be used and interactive features to make them more useful such as being able to zoom in and out with your phone. Another feature I like is the speech navigation which is very useful and safer on the road and prevents the user form looking at the phone instead of driving which could cause accidents. The third traditional data visualization is scatter plots. This type of visualization is used for represent x and y coordinates and mostly used for scientific research. The fourth is charts which represent data in line, bars or slice forms. It is usually used to represent sizes, dimensions or amounts of something and I often like to think of charts and tables as the same because they are one of the easiest data representations to understand and use. They are used in various research fields to show the progression of data and its performance. 
                    The data visualization methods are not the only ones with some being used more that others. There are also diagrams, graphs waveforms and volume. A good data visualization consists of coherent meaning, understanding and readability with aesthetics being the last to be considered.

                    In conclusion what I have gathered from this reading is that data visualization facilitates an understanding of data by using visual aids to represent information. Looking at charts and diagrams is easier than having to go through pages and pages of information making gaining knowledge quicker and easier. I have included some of my own views of the topics discussed in the chapter and additional research to support my statements and for a better understanding. There are different visuals that are used to represent this information such as maps, charts, scatter plots, tables, diagrams and so on and these are just a few that were discussed in the chapter. Data visualization should be readable and coherent, and their design of effectiveness are not dependent on aesthetics. 
                    However, over time aesthetics have been seen to have an impact to influencing users ease at viewing the data.
