                Data visualization is a term with scientific meaning embedded in it as it supports analytic reasoning however (Wattenburg, 2007) suggest that data visualization can also be seen as a lens for sense-making when data is presented as information in digital media. In recent years there has been a different type of information/data visualization that has seen some success which is represented in art form. In this paper I will be doing a critical reflection on the artwork I have chosen to represent my chosen dataset. 
                I will discuss what data-driven art work is and reasons why data visualization as artworks is also as significant and can communicate as efficiently as plain data visualization.

                Before I proceed with looking into my desired artwork I want to define what data-driven artwork or rather artistic visualizations are. Art as a term in itself has been difficult to define and so has the artistic visualization term, however (Wattenburg, 2007) have coined a working definition. In simple terms artistic data visualization is data visualizations done by artists with the intention of making art using actual data rather than a metaphor (Wattenburg, 2007). 
                The data set that I have chosen to represent shows the population of the top ten most populous countries from the year 2018 which was prepared by the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs in the United Nations. For my data-driven artwork I will be making a Choropleth map which is a map that visualises geographical areas on the world map by using different colours and shades in the different regions to present geographical demographics and features in those regions. To execute this artwork I will be using D3 and ideally my idea or vision with this artwork is for it to look realistic with features such as being able to zoom it in and interact with the map by clicking on the different regions. I got this inspiration from one of the data art examples provided to us by our lecturer. The website is called ‘information is beautiful’ and it is dedicated to making the world make sense through graphics and visuals (McCandless, 2022). The definition of artistic data visualization that I make reference to in this paper avoids the issue of beauty and that visualization artworks must be pretty because the importance lies in the intent of the data (Wattenburg, 2007). 
                I do not disagree with this statement as art is not always meant to be beautiful but its meant to be understood and felt through its meaning. 
                I on the other hand do appreciate beautiful art and if I am to make a data artwork it should reflect beauty.

                To execute my artwork as I have mentioned I will be making use of D3.js. Accessibility is a big part of my website and so I chose to cater to the colour-blind and my colour aesthetics so far have tried to reflect this. In this case there are colour combinations that do not work well or aren’t kind to the visually impaired therefore I have to do my research thoroughly so that my use of colour sticks to my website requirements. I want my map to be colourful and vibrant because that is a significant part of pulling this artwork off. The reason I chose to represent my data in this type of artwork is because my dataset is about the world population and what better way to visualize it than using the world map.
                 This will help visualize the size of the country in comparison to its population. There have been claims that some countries are miss represented on the map however I think this will help in the comparison of the size and the number of people and with this I believe that my artwork will enhance the dataset. Each country that is in the top ten most populous will be represented with a different colour and allow the reader to see the number of people there are in that country and show the development rate at which that country is in. The map will also allow the user to zoom in and out. 
                While bar graphs and pie charts are effective as data representation when it comes to exploring information regarding geography, interactive maps are the answer. Data represented in this was is easy to identify, locate and effectively communicate geographical information (Grover, 2021). My aim with the artwork is to try preserve the integrity of the data set and I will be doing so by making sure that the figures which are the main focus are shown properly through labelling the regions and having the colour codes that explain what is on the map on the side. Presenting the data in this way will help declutter information in a fun and interactive way for the user and imply that artistic data visualization helps make sense of information/data that is not easily accessible to the public and that they may not understand like political or economic issues and in my case demographic and geographic issues.

                Data artists have come up with ways to represent data in ways that we would not expect from turning it into a series of shapes or even colours and it has helped with understanding data more efficiently. My planning documentation for my data-driven artwork will be found in the relevant style guide section of my website and it visualises how I will structure the artwork in the site.
                 As the paper concludes I have explained and analysed reasons for my chosen artwork and supported it with references from research papers and additional inspiration that helped me come up with my artwork. The power of visualization is in its efforts of expressing a point of view (Wattenburg, 2007) and this is what I have and hope my artwork will do.
