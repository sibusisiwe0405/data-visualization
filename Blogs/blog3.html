    The meaning of what or how to define interaction in the context of visualization has been challenging to define however this challenge is confusing due to the lack of consensual definitions in the HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) field (Perin, 2020). 
    Interaction as a term on its own is an understood concept however it is unclear how it relates to visualisation and over the years it has been associated with allowing end users the freedom to reconstruct and personalise visualizations, but this still does not fully define the concept. This paper then addresses the problem by capturing what is currently in the visualization community and HCI community and identifying what is different and similar between the two.
     Extensive research was then done through a method rationale, collecting papers, questionnaires, and tagging method.

    Before diving into analysing and defining what interaction for visualization is I will define interaction and visualization as individual terms. Interaction is a reaction that happens when an object or element has an effect on another through some form of contact. Data visualization is the representation of processed data in visual forms such as in charts and graphs which makes it easy to understand big or small data. As it stands there is no direct definition on what interaction is in its involvement with visualization and to address this issue the researchers have come up with various ways to analysis and come up with the definition because interaction is in fact important in visualization.
     A critical review was done to identify important items in the field of data visualization and it looked at three aspects: the need for expert input, snowballing approach would not provide concrete results because it is biased and lastly papers on HCI which did not include visualization should not be included (Perin, 2020). In the attempt of following the requirements the papers that were to be used needed to be measured according to two metrics. This process helped with identifying relevant and impactful papers. Research questionnaire forms were sent out asking for definition papers, papers with the interaction topic, the years of experience they had on visualization and interaction experience based on a 7-point scale. 
     The collection of papers was done in a 4-step method which helped get linked papers from the seed papers collected. The next process was tagging papers with interaction themes. The tags developed characterised seed and linked papers using a coding method and there were 6 tags developed. First tag- Definition of Interaction was an attempt to defining interaction, second tag- Critical on Interaction which looked at negative aspects to discover areas to improve and challenges. 
    The third tag- Benefits of Interaction with the positive aspects, fourth tag- Interaction Concepts involving papers that had archetypal descriptions of interactions. The fifth tag- Interactive pipeline which involved interaction in relation to visualization papers which had the word ‘pipeline’ and lastly the sixth tag- List, a list was made that was described with words such as taxonomy, classification, typology and categorization (Perin, 2020).

    After the selection of seed and linked papers 32 papers with a definition tag defining interaction implicitly or explicitly were looked at and revealed external and internal entities, external and internal actions (Perin, 2020). In the external entities there’s the data and user involved where the user is human and initiates the interaction and the data being information that the user takes interest in.
     Within the internal entities interaction is seen as a goal-oriented activity with intent going beyond collecting and correct data. External actions involve interaction as dialogue between a user and a visualization system where the user inputs an action into the system and it provides and output. Internal actions then involve cognitive acts by the user. Interaction has related terms which are used interchangeably however have different meanings such as interaction technique, interactivity, and science of interaction. With these terms being used interchangeably and them internalizing the notion of interaction the more necessary it is to have a clear view of what interaction is. 
    The papers that were selected helped narrow things down to three concepts that contextualize interaction for visualization: system, task and human centric. With these factors put into consideration it builds a higher-level view of interaction that relates to mental models, actions that take place during decision-making, sense making and problem solving (Perin, 2020).

    The HCI view on interaction characterizes seven concepts of interaction in HCI and explains how they all formulate good interaction. The first concept is dialogue, and it views interaction as a cycle of communication acts and channels interaction through input and output from a computer’s perspective (Perin, 2020). 
    Transmission views interaction as a way of transmitting information between the computer and the user. Control is the interactive minimization of error with respect to user targets and the tool-use concept sees interaction as a way in which the user interacts with the computer. Optimal behaviour views interaction as maximizing utility the best way a user knows how within some constraints however utility does not equate to efficiency. Embodiment sees interaction as making the user feel one with the technology, like its an extension of themselves and experience is shaped the users expectations and places human experience as the main factor of how the interaction plays out.
     After looking at the HCI concepts the researcher then extend the view of interaction in visualization through the lens of HCI and this was done by extending the scope of user intent, user profiling, and extending the scope of what good interaction is.

    Key differences between visualization and HCI were identified which were related to entities, focus, intent and flexibility of interaction. With the research papers and concepts that were looked into the definition of interaction for visualization has come down to two assumptions: ‘interactions with visualizations are a subset of the interactions with interactive systems’ and ‘interactions with interactive systems are a subset of interactions with peoples own mind and environment’ (Perin, 2020). 
    From the findings and comparisons of different concepts one can finally define interaction for visualization as the interplay between a person and a data-interface with an action from the person and an interface reaction.
     With the definition in place it consists of various interaction components such as: interplay, person, data interface, action, action-reaction, and data related intent.

    Like any other research there comes limitations and with this paper the definition that it concluded with can be one amongst many others. The researchers found the review was not comprehensive as some the important perspectives were left out because of limitations from expert input and methods used (Perin, 2020).
     To conclude this definition can be used as a thinking tool for others to come up with other ways to define what interaction in data visualisation is.
