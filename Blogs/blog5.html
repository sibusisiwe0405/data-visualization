    In this last semester we have engaged with topics such as data visualization, artistic visualization, their representation. All these are concepts with their own meanings and definitions however what will be looked at in this paper is their relation to each other. 
    The paper will be a critical analysis and reflection on how data visualization and data art make use of the strategy of representation with references to readings from class and research done outside the given material.
</p>
<p>
    Before getting into discussing the relationship between the concepts I will take a look at the definitions first. Data visualization or also often referred to as information visualization is the translation of information (processed data) into a visual context such as graph imagery, charts or maps for sense-making to the human brain (Brush, 2022).
     Artistic visualization which I will refer to as data art is visualization of data created by artists with the intention of making art. 
    These artworks must be based of actual data-sets instead of already made visualizations and the definition avoids the issue of beauty therefore the artwork does not have to be pretty (Wattenberg, 2007). The artwork has to preserve the integrity of the data which is being visualized. In his work of  Representation Kidd (Kidd, 2015) references (Webb 2009: 3) argument that representation is implicated in the process of positing and identifying ourselves in the world. 
    It is pointed out that representation is a key point of forming who we are as individuals and expressing differences in culture and communities. Representation is a way in which meaning is constructed (Kidd, 2015) and therefore it is not straightforward and can be looked at in various lenses. In the case of this paper it will be looked at as a visual communicator.

    Data visualization and data art both function as visual communicators as they make use of visuals and imagery making them open and suggestive to different interpretations than other forms of communication (Kidd, 2015). They represent or present us with big data made simple and informative to allow for quick decision making (depending on the context) and it could help with getting the audiences attention. The effectiveness of visualizations and aesthetic considerations both have visual attention in common (Enns, 2002).  Most of the time context is very important when it comes to representation, meaning the form used as a representation also plays a big role in executing the presentation right and in this case preserving the integrity of the data. Context is everything and there are several different contexts within which one should understand the use of and image (Kidd, 2015).
     Not all graphs or charts will be appropriate for visualizing data because the type of visualization that will be used is dependent on the type of data that needs to be presented. For example for one of my assignments I used a pie chart to visualize the worlds population only to be told later on that type of visualization was not fitting for my data-set(context) because pie charts are used to assume the sum of all the pieces are out of 100 and my data was about comparing the world population between the 10 most populated countries.
     It is simply not possible to have truly neutral visualizations however the traditional visualization tools have tried to minimize distortion to avoid interference with data analysis and in contrast with artworks their value rests in their power of visualization to express a point of view (Wattenberg, 2007). In representation an artwork can never maintain its authenticity and in the same light dataset being visualised loses authenticity and embodies a new form for better understanding. With artistic visualizations being new in the visualization community, the data/information community can learn a few things when it comes to representation and embracing that visualizations can persuade as well as be used for analysis (Wattenberg, 2007).

    When one thinks of scientific visualization, we think the images presented show one single truth or reality however that given dataset can tell different stories depending on the questions asked of it or the filters applied to answer those questions (Leetaru, 2019). Both data visualization and data art share the same common ground in being important in almost every career field as they can be used to explore advancements in new technologies or be it in finance offices to share information with stakeholders or potential investors. With data art being new in the visualization community a new concept has also risen; techno-art.
     Techno-art is art that reflects and engages with risky technology by enhancing decision making regarding technology risks and help overcome stalemates and improve on technology innovations (Janssens, 2016). Artists have become increasing interested in new technological advancements however others have had their concerns as they feel these technologies might be risky. It is argued that new technologies provide new material possibilities and can open new topics to be engaged with (Janssens, 2016). Techno-art reaches out to people by engaging their imaginations and emotional capacities with vivid narratives that make technological advancement and their possibilities more appealing to a larger audience and create awareness for societal issues. Techno-art like data visualization and data art appeal to people through the use of imagery and visual representations to help better understand situations and influence them to make informed decisions. In a general sense, it is argued that artworks help our ethical and political thinking  (Janssens, 2016). 
    This new form of art has been seen as a rapidly expanding form of artistry and could make a major contribution to society.

    The critical engagement and reflection on some of the readings provided to us have shown how data visualization and data art both work as forms of representation. We see how art works as a tool to enhance and help with understanding information and make informed decisions from it. 
    In his work Representation (Kidd, 2015) states that the way in which information is presented has weight regardless of the actual value of information or its impact on society. The two concepts may be different however they work hand in hand in some instances or rather their strategies and goals are the same and context is the important factor in determining which one can be used.
