    <p class="writing">
        Below i have attached images of the wireframes i have designed that show the landing pages for the different sections i have. The first one is my home landing page, though i had imagined doing something different i chose to stick to this because i was afraid of risking a new style and have my users confused.
        The layout i currently have has a traditional and familiar look which makes it easy for users to use and accessible. 
        The second one is of my blog landing page. It has card like images with titles which the user clicks on and it takes them to the blog. The blogs have previous and next buttons so the user reads and clicks on the button instead of clicking on the nav bar and going back to the landing page.
        The third image is of the data visualistaion section and how i would like it to look eventually as it stands the graphs are on separate pages and the user uses buttons to go to the next one. 
        The fourth wireframe is of the interactive graph that is similar to my second static graph however whn the mouse hovers over the pie pieces the pieces pop out. I am aware that it is not much of an interactive graph therefore i am still working on finding an appropriate graph/chart to use.
        The last wireframe is the layout of my data-driven artwork. I have explained my reasons for representing my data set in this type of artwork. You can read more about it in blog 4 under <a href="./Blogs/blog4.html" class="link">Data-driven art.</a>

    <p class="writing"> Below is my chosen color palette which caters to the visually impaired. I wanted accessibility to be a big part of my website therefore the color combinations i have used even on the pie chart.
        The fonts chosen are simple and represent a traditional feel. I did not want to have fancy fonts which may not correspond with the theme of my site and the information represented in it.
    I have not added the fonts on this page however when the site is complete i will have the font sample. </p>
